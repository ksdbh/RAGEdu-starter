# Backend: RAG API

This page will zoom in on the `/rag/answer` endpoint, describing:

- Request and response shapes in more detail.
- How query vs question fields are handled.
- How guardrails, logging, and citations are applied.

For now, see [Backend endpoints](../backend.md) and `backend/app/main.py` / `backend/app/rag.py`.
