# Backend: Auth & identity

This page will provide a focused description of EduRAG's auth model and related
endpoints, including:

- How the mock and real Cognito clients work (`backend/app/auth.py`).
- Which endpoints exercise auth behavior (`/whoami`, `/protected/*`, `/greeting`).
- How to interpret roles and tokens in local development vs production.

Until this is expanded, see `backend/app/auth.py` and [Backend endpoints](../backend.md).
