# Guide: Add a new course

This guide will walk through ingesting a brand new course into EduRAG, covering:

- Preparing course materials (slides, PDFs, syllabus).
- Running the ingest CLI with an appropriate `course_id`.
- Verifying that chunks and embeddings were created as expected.
- Issuing sample queries against the new course.

Until this is fleshed out, combine [Getting Started](../getting-started.md)
with the [Ingestion](../rag/ingestion.md) docs.
