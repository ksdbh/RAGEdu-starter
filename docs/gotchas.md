# Common gotchas

- Token vs Bearer: FastAPI HTTPBearer expects the token after "Bearer ". In local mock tests you can pass bare tokens in Authorization header.
- Vector dims mismatch: When creating OpenSearch index ensure the embedding dim matches the embeddings you write.
- Real AWS vs stubs: setting COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID or AWS_ENDPOINT_URL will change behavior â€” review logs carefully.
