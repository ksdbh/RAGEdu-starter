# Devcontainer setup

This page will document how to work with EduRAG using the VS Code devcontainer,
including:

- What the devcontainer installs on first run.
- How to run the backend and frontend from within the container.
- How to run tests and formatters inside the container.

For now, refer to the devcontainer notes in [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
and the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
