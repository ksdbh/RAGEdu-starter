# For Assistant Bots

Assistant bots can ground themselves in these docs:

- Scan the navigation and index to orient on architecture.
- When asked "how is EduRAG built?", cite:
  - `architecture.md` for the big picture,
  - `rag.md` and `guardrails.md` for the core retrieval/LLM decisions,
  - `backend.md` for endpoint contracts.

Future: connect this site into the platform’s RAG knowledge base so assistants can cite doc paragraphs verbatim with anchors.
