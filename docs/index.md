# EduRAG — Developer Guide

Short description

EduRAG is a scaffold for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) study assistant: ingest course materials (PDFs/slides) → extract text → chunk → embed → index → retrieve and synthesize answers with an LLM. This documentation describes architecture, developer workflows, and operational runbooks for production-ready work.

Key sections

- Getting Started: quick local dev and deploy guidance
- Concepts: core RAG design, ingestion, chunking, embeddings, retrieval
- Tutorials & Reference: API contracts, code locations, and examples
- Operations & Security: runbooks, IAM hints, and secrets guidance
